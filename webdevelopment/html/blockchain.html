    <p>A <b>blockchain</b> is a distributed ledger with growing lists of records (blocks) that are securely linked together via cryptographic hashes.<mark>[1][2][3][4] Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block</mark>, a timestamp, and <del>transaction</del> transfer data (generally represented as a Merkle tree, where data nodes are represented by leaves).<br> Since each block contains information about the previous block, they effectively form a chain (compare linked list data structure), with each additional block linking to the ones before it.<br>

        Consequently, blockchain transactions are irreversible in that, once they are recorded, the data in any given block cannot be altered retroactively without altering all subsequent blocks. <hr> 2H<sub>2</sub>+O<sub>2</sub>= =2H<sub>2</sub>O
